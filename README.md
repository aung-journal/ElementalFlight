# ElementalFlight Game Design Document

## Overview
ElementalFlight is an elemental-themed game inspired by the classic "Flappy Bird" gameplay. Players control an elemental creature's flight through a scrolling environment filled with obstacles of various elemental types. The core mechanic involves matching the player's elemental type with the obstacle's type for safe passage. Collecting elemental orbs and power-ups adds depth and strategy to the gameplay.

## Game Mechanics

### Controls
Players control the elemental creature's flight by tapping or clicking on the screen. Each tap causes the creature to flap its wings or use its elemental abilities to move upward.

### Obstacles
- The game is set in a horizontally scrolling environment with various obstacles like pillars, walls, or moving objects.
- Obstacles come in different colors and elemental types.
- Elemental Matching is crucial for navigating obstacles safely.

### Elemental Matching
- The player's elemental creature must match its type with the obstacle's type to pass through it unharmed.
- Example: A fire obstacle requires a fire elemental creature for safe passage, and the same principle applies to water, earth, and other elements.

### Elemental Orbs
- Scattered throughout the level are elemental orbs, each corresponding to one of the elemental types.
- Players collect orbs by flying through them.
- Collecting orbs serves two purposes:
    1. Changes the elemental type of the player's creature to the type of the collected orb.
    2. Grants points, rewards, or power-ups based on the collected orb's color.

### Challenges
- As players progress, obstacles become more complex and challenging.
- Challenges may include navigating through narrow gaps, avoiding moving obstacles, or dealing with obstacles that require quick elemental type changes.

### Power-Ups
- Special power-up orbs provide temporary advantages, such as:
    - Invincibility: Allows the player to pass through any obstacle regardless of type.
    - Increased Speed: Boosts the creature's flight speed.
    - Elemental Mastery: Temporarily allows the player to match any elemental obstacle type.
    
## Scoring and Objectives
- Primary Objective: Travel as far as possible while collecting orbs and safely passing through obstacles.
- Players earn points for each collected orb and successfully cleared obstacle.
- Additional objectives may include missions, challenges, or achievements to provide variety and additional goals.

## Graphics and Art
- The game should feature visually appealing elemental-themed graphics and animations for creatures, orbs, and obstacles.
- Each elemental type should have a unique visual style, making it easy for players to identify and match with obstacles.

## Sound and Music
- Engaging sound effects for creature flight, orb collection, and obstacle interactions.
- Thematic background music that complements the elemental atmosphere.

## Platforms
- Initially designed for desktop version due to arrow key based controls
- Potential for IOS/android mobile versions for a broader audience.

## Monetization(Might add later)
- In-app ads: Display ads to generate revenue.
- In-app purchases: Offer cosmetic skins for elemental creatures, additional lives, or power-up packs.

## Conclusion
ElementalFlight combines the addictive gameplay of "Flappy Bird" with elemental mechanics and matching challenges. With visually appealing graphics, immersive sound, and engaging gameplay, it promises to captivate players as they strive to conquer increasingly difficult obstacles and achieve high scores.
