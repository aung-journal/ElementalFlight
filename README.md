# ElementalFlight
A elemental game with flappy bird behaviour

# Game Mechanics:

    ## Controls: Players control the elemental creature's flight by tapping or clicking on the screen. Each tap causes the creature to flap its wings or use its elemental abilities to move upward.

    Obstacles: The game is set in a horizontally scrolling environment with various obstacles like pillars, walls, or moving objects. These obstacles are of different colors and elemental types.

    Elemental Matching: The core mechanic of the game is elemental matching. To pass through obstacles unharmed, the player's elemental creature must match its type with the obstacle's type. For example:
        A fire obstacle can only be passed through safely if the player's elemental creature is of the fire type.
        A water obstacle requires a water elemental creature for safe passage, and so on.

    Elemental Orbs: Scattered throughout the level are elemental orbs, each corresponding to one of the elemental types. Players need to collect these orbs by flying through them. Collecting orbs serves two purposes:
        It changes the elemental type of the player's creature to the type of the collected orb.
        It grants points, rewards, or power-ups based on the collected orb's color.

    Challenges: As players progress, the obstacles become more complex and challenging. They might need to navigate through narrow gaps, avoid moving obstacles, or deal with obstacles that require quick elemental type changes.

    Power-Ups: Alongside elemental orbs, players can encounter special power-up orbs that provide temporary advantages, such as invincibility, increased speed, or the ability to pass through any obstacle regardless of type.

    Scoring and Objectives: The primary objective is to travel as far as possible while collecting orbs and safely passing through obstacles. Players earn points for each collected orb and successfully cleared obstacle. The game could include missions, challenges, or achievements to provide additional goals.
