To determine the frequency of elemental orbs spawning in the "Elemental Flight" game, you could consider the following factors:

1. Difficulty Level: As the player progresses in the game, you can increase the frequency of elemental orbs to provide more opportunities for type changes and power-ups. This will help keep the game challenging and engaging.

2. Obstacle Density: You can adjust the frequency of elemental orbs based on the density of obstacles in the current section of the level. If there are more obstacles in a particular area, consider increasing the frequency of orbs to give players a better chance of finding the right type to pass through.

3. Player Performance: You can also consider the player's performance in the game. For example, if the player is struggling to pass through obstacles or collect orbs, you can increase the frequency of orbs to provide them with more chances to improve their situation.

4. Randomness: It's important to introduce an element of randomness to the spawning of elemental orbs. This will prevent the game from becoming predictable and allow for unexpected challenges and rewards.

By combining these factors, you can create a dynamic and balanced spawning system for the elemental orbs in "Elemental Flight" that keeps the gameplay exciting and enjoyable for the players.
